--------------------------------------------------------------------

EchidNet is highly inspired on the simple yet good LeNet-5 (LeCun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio, and P. Haffner, 1998) architecture, hyperparameters like kernels, depth and linear layers have been changed as well as hyperbolic tangent has been switched for ReLu6.

## About
EchidNet has a total of 20.007 parameters and it takes only 83.8kB on disk.

Latency: around 0.65ms on Cuda.
